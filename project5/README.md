PROJECT 5 FYS4150 <br />

THE DIFFUSION EQUATION <br />
----------------------
ONE DIMENSIONAL SOLVER
----------------------
diffusion1D.f90 includes three different schemes <br />
to solve the one dimensional diffusion equation.  <br />
Instructions are given as docstrings in the code. <br />
<br />
The module tridiag_module.f90 is authored by Lars Frogner and is used in diffusion1D.f90. <br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------
TWO DIMENSIONAL SOLVER
----------------------
diffusion2D.f90 includes the jaboci method to solve <br />
the diffusion equation in two dimensions. <br />
